# ðŸ§  FAANG-Crucial Dynamic Programming Problems: Strings & Arrays

This guide presents a **comprehensive list of classical Dynamic Programming (DP) problems** focused on **strings** and **arrays**, **must-learn for FAANG-level interviews**. These problems not only build a strong foundation but also help you recognize patterns that frequently recur in technical rounds. 

> âœ… Each base problem is followed by **associated/similar problems** you must solve to master the pattern.
