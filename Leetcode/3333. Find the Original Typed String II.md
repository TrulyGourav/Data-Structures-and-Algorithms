# 🔁 Find the Original Typed String II (Leetcode 3333)

## 📝 Problem Summary

Alice is typing a string on her computer, but sometimes she presses a key for too long, which causes characters to repeat multiple times.

You are given:
- A string `word` — the final result seen on the screen (with possible long presses),
- An integer `k` — the minimum length of the original string she was trying to type.

Your task is to count the number of possible **original strings** that could have resulted in `word` after possibly holding down some keys too long, **where the original string has length at least `k`**.

Return the total number of valid original strings modulo **1,000,000,007**.

---

## 💡 Intuition

The core idea is:
- Every group of repeated characters in `word` was caused by pressing a single character for too long.
- So, each such group corresponds to **1 to n** possible original characters (where `n` is the number of repeated characters in the group).
- We can use this observation to count total possible original strings by multiplying the sizes of these ranges.

However, we are **only interested in original strings of length ≥ k**. So we need to subtract the number of combinations where the reconstructed original string length is less than `k`.

---

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Group repeated characters** in `word`:
   - For example, `"aabbbc"` → groups of lengths `[2, 3, 1]`

2. **Total combinations without restriction**:
   - For each group of length `g`, we can have `1` to `g` original characters.
   - So total combinations = `g1 * g2 * ... * gn` (modulo 10⁹+7)

3. **Count invalid combinations (original string length < k)** using **dynamic programming**:
   - Let `dp[j]` be the number of ways to build an original string of length `j` using some prefix of the group array.
   - We initialize `dp[0] = 1` (base case: empty string).
   - For each group, use **sliding window** to add possible choices (1 to g).
   - Sum up all `dp[j]` values where `j < k`.

4. **Final answer**:
   - Subtract invalid combinations from total combinations.
   - Return the result modulo 1,000,000,007.

## 📌 Example

Let’s look at a few examples to clarify:

**Example 1**  
Input: `word = "aabbccdd"`, `k = 7`  
Explanation:  
Grouped as: [2,2,2,2]  
Each group can contribute 1 or 2 characters (i.e., choices).  
Total combinations = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16  
But we need to exclude those with original length < 7  
Valid original strings (with length ≥ 7) = 5  
✅ Output: `5`

**Example 2**  
Input: `word = "aabbccdd"`, `k = 8`  
Here, only the full original string (`aabbccdd`) has length 8.  
✅ Output: `1`

**Example 3**  
Input: `word = "aaabbb"`, `k = 3`  
Groups = [3,3]  
Each group has 3 choices (1 to 3): total = 3 × 3 = 9  
Only 1 combination has length < 3  
✅ Output: `8`

---

## 🧪 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + k × g)`
  - `n` = length of word
  - `g` = number of character groups (≤ n)
  - `k` = given minimum required length
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` due to the dynamic programming array

## ✅ Java Code

```java
class Solution {
  public int possibleStringCount(String word, int k) {
    List<Integer> groups = getConsecutiveLetters(word);
    final int totalCombinations =
        (int) groups.stream().mapToLong(Integer::longValue).reduce(1L, (a, b) -> a * b % MOD);
    if (k <= groups.size())
      return totalCombinations;

    int[] dp = new int[k];
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: one way to form empty string

    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); ++i) {
      int[] newDp = new int[k];
      int windowSum = 0;
      int group = groups.get(i);
      for (int j = i; j < k; ++j) {
        newDp[j] = (newDp[j] + windowSum) % MOD;
        windowSum = (windowSum + dp[j]) % MOD;
        if (j >= group)
          windowSum = (windowSum - dp[j - group] + MOD) % MOD;
      }
      dp = newDp;
    }

    final int invalidCombinations = Arrays.stream(dp).reduce(0, (a, b) -> (a + b) % MOD);
    return (totalCombinations - invalidCombinations + MOD) % MOD;
  }

  private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

  // Returns lengths of consecutive identical characters, e.g. "aabbbc" -> [2, 3, 1]
  private List<Integer> getConsecutiveLetters(final String word) {
    List<Integer> groups = new ArrayList<>();
    int group = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); ++i) {
      if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(i - 1)) {
        ++group;
      } else {
        groups.add(group);
        group = 1;
      }
    }
    groups.add(group);
    return groups;
  }
}
