# 🧩 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I

## 📝 Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a string game. Initially, Alice has a string:  
```
word = "a"
```

Bob repeatedly asks Alice to perform this operation **forever**:

- Generate a new string by changing **each character** in `word` to its **next character** in the English alphabet (wrapping `z → a`).
- Append this generated string to the original `word`.

This continues until `word` becomes long enough to contain **at least** `k` characters.

**Return** the `k`-th character of the final string.

---

### Rules:
- Next character after `'z'` is `'a'`.
- Characters are 0-indexed in logic but answer is 1-indexed (`k`-th position).

---

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1
```
Input: k = 5
Operations:
Initial:     "a"
1st step →   "ab"       (append next of 'a' → 'b')
2nd step →   "abbc"     (append next of 'a','b' → 'b','c')
3rd step →   "abbcbccd"

Output: "b"
```

### Example 2
```
Input: k = 10
Operations:
Initial:     "a"
1st step →   "ab"
2nd step →   "abbc"
3rd step →   "abbcbccd"
4th step →   "abbcbccddeedd"

Output: "c"
```

## 🔍 Intuition and Approach

### 🔄 Pattern Insight
Each time, we:
1. Copy the current string.
2. Convert each character to its *next* character in the alphabet (wrap `z → a`).
3. Append the result.

We repeat this until the string has **at least `k` characters**.

Rather than working with characters directly, we store them as **integers** from `0` (→ 'a') to `25` (→ 'z') and apply modular arithmetic.

### 💡 Why use `mod 26`?
To keep characters within the 'a'–'z' range. After 'z' (`25`), `(25 + 1) % 26 = 0`, which wraps back to `'a'`.

## ✅ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(k) — In worst-case we may simulate all k characters step-by-step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) — We store up to k characters in the list.

## 👨‍💻 Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public char kthCharacter(int k) {
        // Store the encoded characters: 0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'
        List<Integer> word = new ArrayList<>();
        word.add(0); // Initial string is "a" → encoded as 0

        // Keep extending the list until it has at least k characters
        while (word.size() < k) {
            int currentSize = word.size();

            // For each character in current list, append its "next" character
            for (int i = 0; i < currentSize; ++i) {
                int nextChar = (word.get(i) + 1) % 26;
                word.add(nextChar);
            }
        }

        // Convert encoded number to character: 0 → 'a', 1 → 'b', ..., 25 → 'z'
        return (char) ('a' + word.get(k - 1));
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Further Ideas

- Can we find a way to **avoid full list construction** using mathematical patterns?
- Can this be solved using **recursion** or **binary search-like simulation**?
- Is there an **efficient memory-saving approach** for large values of `k`?

---

## 📌 Key Concepts Recap

- Modular arithmetic (`(x + 1) % 26`) to wrap alphabet.
- Use of **List<Integer>** to represent characters efficiently.
- Simple simulation until desired length is reached.
