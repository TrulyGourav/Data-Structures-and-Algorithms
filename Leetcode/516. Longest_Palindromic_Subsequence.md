# 🧩 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the **length** of the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`.

- A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- The subsequence **does not need to be contiguous**.
- Your goal is to **maximize the length** of such a subsequence that is a **palindrome**.

### 🧪 Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

## 💡 INTUITION (Very Important)

> 🎯 The longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in a string is actually the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** between the string and its **reverse**.

Why?  
A palindrome is the same forward and backward.  
So if you take a string `s` and its reverse `rev(s)`, the **LCS of both will give the length of the longest palindromic subsequence**.

This clever trick allows us to **reduce this problem into a well-known dynamic programming pattern: LCS**.

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

- **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)** is a classic DP problem.
- For strings `A` and `B`, `LCS(i, j)` represents the length of the LCS of the first `i` characters of A and first `j` characters of B.
- In our case, we're comparing the original string `s` with its reverse `rev(s)`.

---

## 🧭 Approach

1. Let `text1 = s` and `text2 = reverse(s)`
2. Initialize a `dp[][]` table where `dp[i][j]` holds the LCS of `text1[0…i-1]` and `text2[0…j-1]`
3. Traverse both strings:
   - If characters match, take diagonal: `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
   - Else take max of top or left: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
4. Final answer is `dp[m][n]` where `m = text1.length` and `n = text2.length`

## 📦 Code Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        String text1 = s;
        String text2 = new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();

        int m = text1.length();
        int n = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| 🕒 Time     | `O(n^2)` – We fill a 2D DP table of size n x n |
| 💾 Space    | `O(n^2)` – For the 2D `dp[][]` table |

*Can be optimized to `O(n)` space using 2 rolling arrays instead of full matrix.*

## 📐 Sample DP Table Dry Run (for "bbbab")

| i/j |  | b | b | b | a | b |
|-----|--|---|---|---|---|---|
|     | 0| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| b   | 0| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| a   | 0| 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| b   | 0| 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| b   | 0| 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| b   | 0| 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |

Final answer at `dp[5][5] = 4`

## 🧠 Tip to Remember the Logic Forever

> 🪞**"Palindrome is its own mirror — just find the common part in the mirror."**

Visualize your string and its mirror image.  
Instead of searching directly for a palindrome, just **find what's common between the original and the reverse**.

💡 **Tagline Trick:**
> "LCS of string and its mirror gives the Palindrome's shimmer."

📝 Mnemonic:
- `S` + `reverse(S)` → **LCS** → Longest Palindromic Subsequence  
- Anytime palindrome + subsequence → **Think LCS!**
