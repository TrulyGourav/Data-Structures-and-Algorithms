# 474. Ones and Zeroes

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given
- An array of binary strings `strs`
- Two integers `m` and `n`

### Task
Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that
- The total number of `'0'`s is at most `m`
- The total number of `'1'`s is at most `n`

A set `x` is a subset of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

---

### 🧠 Intuition (💡 Highlighted)

This is a variation of the 01 Knapsack problem, but instead of
- weights and values, we’re using
  - `0` counts = one kind of weight
  - `1` counts = another kind of weight
- The value of each item is `1` (since we want the max number of strings in subset)

We want to choose a subset of strings such that
- Total 0s ≤ m
- Total 1s ≤ n
- And we get the maximum count of strings included

⛳ So this is a 2D Knapsack where each string costs
- some 0s
- some 1s

### 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

 Technique        Time Complexity          Space Complexity        
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bottom-Up DP    O(L × m × n)              O(m × n)                 

Where `L = strs.length`

---

## 🔍 Conceptual Understanding

For each string
1. Count how many 0s and 1s it has.
2. Try to update the DP table
   - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1)`

We go backwards while updating to avoid overwriting states we still need to use.

## 🌳 Recursive Tree Visualization

Let's take a smaller example

Input  
`strs = [10, 0001, 1, 0]`, `m = 3`, `n = 2`

DP Grid before processing

j → (1s)
i↓ (0s)
0 1 2
0 [0 0 0]
1 [0 0 0]
2 [0 0 0]
3 [0 0 0]

Now, for string `10` → 1 zero, 1 one  
Start from bottom-right and update up-left (`i` from m → 0 and `j` from n → 0)

e.g.,  
`dp[3][2] = max(dp[3][2], dp[2][1] + 1)`

Updated grid shows how we pack strings using 0s and 1s capacity.

## ✅ Java Code (Bottom-Up DP)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (String str  strs) {
            int zeros = 0, ones = 0;

            for (char c  str.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '0') zeros++;
                else ones++;
            }

            for (int i = m; i = zeros; i--) {
                for (int j = n; j = ones; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
🧵 Other Approaches (Summary Table)
Approach	Description	Time	Space	Status
Brute Force (DFS)	Try all subsets, count 0s and 1s, and prune if exceeds limit	Exponential	High	❌ (Inefficient)
Top-Down DP (Memoization)	Use recursion + memo on (i, m, n)	O(L×m×n)	O(L×m×n)	✅
Bottom-Up DP	2D DP array using reverse loop (shown above)	O(L×m×n)	O(m×n)	✅ (Optimal)

🧠 How to Never Forget This Logic (Memory Tip)
🔁 Treat each string as a tiny backpack item with cost = (0s,1s) and value = 1 — then pack your bag (m and n) just like a 2D knapsack!

10 ➜ needs 1 slot of 0s, 1 slot of 1s  
Your backpack 5 slots for 0s, 3 for 1s  
Pick strings to max the number you carry!
🔥 Final Words
This problem is gold for mastering knapsack patterns and interview storytelling.
Make sure you

Always reverse loop during DP update (to not overwrite earlier decisions).

Use count of 0s and 1s as your key to weight management.
